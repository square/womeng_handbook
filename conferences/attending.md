# Attending Conferences

## Goals
* Recruit women engineers
* Grow awareness of your company/organization
* Strengthen the bond of your WomEng group

## How it works
Find a conference that aligns with your WomEng group. Some conferences to consider are:

* [Grace Hopper](http://ghc.anitaborg.org/)
* [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com/conference/)
* [Tech Inclusion](http://techinclusion.co/)

Once you choose a conference, draft a proposal outlining any resources you'd like from your company/organization for the group to attend. (This may include the conference fee, traveling costs, or swag to pass out at the conference.) If you're successful, enjoy the experience with your WomEng group and be prepared to network.
