# Monthly Roundtable

## Goals
* Create a safe environment to hold personal conversations.
* Create a trustworthy and supportive WomEng group.

## How it works
First and foremost, create ground rules. Some ground rules from Block's monthly roundtable are:

* No discussing the topics of conversation or commentary from the monthly roundtable outside of the group.
* When discussing controversial or personal topics, no calling out individuals by name.

For your first few roundtables, it's best to have a moderatorâ€”preferably someone with an objective point of view. The moderator should draft talking points and questions for the group. We found that our first roundtable was a bit awkward, but soon people became comfortable and felt the support of the group.

Once the group is comfortable with each other, you can move away from having an outside moderator. Instead, consider gathering topics and questions from the group beforehand through a Google Form; have someone from WomEng volunteer to act as the moderator.
