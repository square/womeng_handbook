# Hear + Now: WomEng Lightning Talks

## Goals
* Speakers become more comfortable and confident with public speaking.
* Grow the women in engineering community internally and outside your organization.

## How it works

### Our Format for Talks
* One person from WomEng volunteers to organize the event. This person works with the events team to reserve a space and the IT team to setup any equipment needed.
* There are five talks total: 1-2 engineers from Block and 3-4 guest speakers.
* Ten minutes is allocated per lightning talk with two minutes for transitions.
* Speakers send their slides to the organizer, who compiles them into one slide deck for the tech talk.

### Logistics
When planning a lightning talk, several logistics need to be confirmed, including:
* The date and time of the event;
* The location;
* The maximum number of attendees;
  * We suggest ⅓ of attendees are from your organization and ⅔ are from external organizations.
  * Plan on having only half of the people who RSVP'd show up to the event. So, you can allow up to twice the number of maximum attendees to RSVP.
* The theme of the event;
  * We suggest you start off with the theme "Lessons Learned." This is broad enough to include a wide-range of talks.
* And, a plan for finding speakers.
  *  We ask our WomEng community to reach out to their networks. We also have a speaker form (created through Google Forms), which we send out via social media to find speakers.

Once all logistics are confirmed, create an invite. At Block, we use [Splash](https://splashthat.com/). Here's an example of a [previous invitation](https://square-womeng.splashthat.com/).

Note: If you're [interested in speaking](https://docs.google.com/a/squareup.com/forms/d/1O3qRZskidjSzwQKedASasPCqEhiEM3UaMOxRHjOjdHM/viewform) at or attending a future Block Hear and Now event, we'd love to hear from you.
