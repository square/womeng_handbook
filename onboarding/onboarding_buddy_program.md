# Onboarding Buddy Program

## Goals
* Grow WomEng through new membership.
* Create a strong bond between WomEng members.

## How it works
Reach out to women engineers who can be a "buddy" to a newly-hired engineer at your company or organization. You'll want to ask for details from both women that will allow you to make a meaningful match. Details can include their interests, alma mater, hometown, previous company, and the team they work on. The pairing process can be owned by someone in WomEng or consider someone on your new-hire onboarding team. Regardless, the two buddies should be introduced during the new hire's first week. After the first meeting, it's up to the buddy to take initiative.

At Block, the buddy is encouraged to send a calendar invite for lunch or coffee by the new hire's second week. If you pair people up in different locations, they can also virtually meet via a streaming service. During this first meeting, the buddy talks through the purpose of WomEng and provides information on recurring events and other groups within Block. Most importantly, they get to know each other and the buddy becomes a resource for the new employee.
