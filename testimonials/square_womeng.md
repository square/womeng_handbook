# Testimonials from Square’s WomEng

> I'm part of a smaller team, so I don't always get to interact with other women engineers on a daily basis. Even so, being involved with Square WomEng means that I never feel alone. Whether we're meeting over lunch to talk about the challenges we face, emailing links to empowering news articles, or chatting on our Slack channel, I feel like I'm a part of an engaged and thriving community of women in engineering (and our allies!). WomEng has helped me to find my voice as a software engineer, fight imposter syndrome, and become more confident in what I bring to the table. Even better, Square WomEng is helping me find ways that I can be a better ally to other underrepresented groups in tech. I'm so glad that I'm starting my career in tech here, as part of this amazing community.

> WomEng is extremely important to me as an engineer. I do not contribute to the Square code base since I work on our People team, and the WomEng group encourages me to continue my learning and pair with senior engineers. I enjoy the lunches, lightning talks, discussions and camaraderie that WomEng provides. WomEng has provided me with a network of women and allies who encourage me to grow as an engineer and find opportunities to gain knowledge that’s applicable to my career.

> I’ve really enjoyed being able to participate in WomEng as an ally. It’s great to be able to show support for the amazing women engineers at Square and become more aware of the issues they struggle with. We’ve created a safe space and community, and I’m honored to be a part of it. There’s a great energy and passion in the group, and the desire to make things better is strong. As an ally, I feel very welcome, and I feel like I can connect with my colleagues in a much more meaningful way after talking about shared struggles, like imposter syndrome. I would encourage anyone who wants to support diversity in tech to get involved at one of our events!
